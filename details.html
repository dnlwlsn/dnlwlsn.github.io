			<h3>What's this about?</h3>
			<p>This page was created for the Simply Business 2023 hackathon. </br>
			   The intention was to create a place for people to share something they can't tell anyone else and need to let go of.  </br>
			   Mental health is as important as physical health. This is a small step towards you taking it more seriously. </br>
			   <p>It has not been optimised for mobile devices.</p>
